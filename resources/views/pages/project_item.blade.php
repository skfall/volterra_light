				<p>In the period from 1754 to 1764, Vilshanka was part of the Novoslobodska Kozak establishment. In years later, the Bulgarian immigrants flooded the settlement. During the war of 1768-1774, Vilshanka was officially protected by the Moldavian troops.  In 19th century, Vilshanka had the status of military village and used to serve the role as one of the control points between Poland and Turkey. </p>

				<p>In the middle of the 19th century, the settlement lost it military status. The civilian population was estimated at 2,543 residents. As no other military intervention affected the lives of people, the population was steadily increasing. The settlement grew in size and infrastructure. </p>

				<p>By 1886, Vilshanka already had a Catholic Church, Jewish Praying House, school, wine warehouse, 8 stores, and regular weekly bazars.  During the Soviet times, in 20th century, Vilshanka has a number of large manufacturing facilities, three libraries, hospital, and other important infrastructure. However, in 1990s, the population dropped by more than 20% due to migration, leaving the extensive infrastructure unattended.</p>
